CustomMap is functionally identical to VerboseCustomMap.
VerboseCustomMap simply has extra System.outs to demonstrate what the program is doing, and also:

	CustomMap 			currently takes input data from  	"shortdict.txt"
	VerboseCustomMap  	currently takes input data from 	"dictionary.txt"

TO WIN a game on VerboseCustomMap.java:
	Compile/run the program,
	Enter the following inputs:
	4
	7
	d
	o
	a
	t
	h
	i
	s

If you have a test case prepared for dictionary.txt, it should 'just work' on CustomMap.
